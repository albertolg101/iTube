# YouTube Player with Search Functionality

## Project Overview

This project is a React-based YouTube Player that allows users to search for videos, play them, and navigate through
video details. The application is styled using Styled Components, and animations are implemented with Framer Motion to
enhance user experience. Users can search for a new video while a current video is playing, ensuring seamless browsing
and playback.
